BibleAndFeelings is a maven project, that depending on the feeling the user is having, and selecting the feeling from the menu, displays a random versicule that covers about, for example, braveness in particular. A lot of versicules are available to read, so you can read multiple versicules of the same feeling, each time. This Console-Jar Application is a great homework to learn how to use Maven and the commands mvn, svn and git.

### How to set it to work and edit it

Since it's a maven project, it can be built and packaged easily.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Rebecasarai/BibleAndFeelings.git
$ cd BibleAndFeelings
$ mvn package
```

### What did I used?

```
